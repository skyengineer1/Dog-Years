# 🐾 Age in Dog Years Calculator

This project calculates your age in **dog years**! 🐶 It's a fun way to explore basic JavaScript concepts like variables, arithmetic, and string interpolation. ✨

## 📜 How It Works
1. The user's age in human years is input as `myAge`.
2. The calculation follows these rules:
   - The first two years of a dog's life count as **10.5 dog years each**.
   - Every year after that counts as **4 dog years**.
3. The results are displayed in a friendly message. 🎉

## 🛠️ Usage
1. Open the `index.js` file.
2. Update the `myAge` variable with your age.
3. Run the script in a JavaScript environment (e.g., Node.js, browser console).
4. See your age in dog years printed in the console! 🐕

## 📂 Project Files
- `index.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for the age-to-dog-years calculation.
